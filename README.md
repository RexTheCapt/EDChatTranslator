# EDTools  
This repo is basically where i test some stuff for ED from time to time and have an journal API which can be used by anyone, but the journal API is not complete.  
  
## CarrierAnnouncer  
This announcer is discontinued for now. I have no plans to update it. The plan was to announce my carrier jumping and other stuff to some discord webhooks. The experiment failed since you have to stay on the carrier for it to work properly.
